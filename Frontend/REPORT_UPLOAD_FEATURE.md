## Code Changes

### Files Modified

1. **Dashboard.jsx**
   - Added `useRef` for file input
   - Added states: `reports`, `uploadingReport`
   - Imported `reportAPI` from services
   - New functions:
     - `loadReports()` - Fetch reports from API
     - `handleFileSelect()` - Trigger file picker
     - `handleFileUpload()` - Handle file upload with validation
     - `handleDeleteReport()` - Delete report functionality

### API Integration

Uses existing `reportAPI` from `services/api.js`:

- `reportAPI.uploadReport(formData)` - Upload file
- `reportAPI.getReports()` - Fetch all reports
- `reportAPI.deleteReport(id)` - Delete report

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Upload Report" button
2. System file dialog opens
3. User selects a medical report file
4. File is validated (type and size)
5. File uploads with progress indicator
6. Success message shown
7. Report appears in the list immediately
8. User can view or delete the report

## File Validation Rules

```javascript
// Allowed MIME types
const allowedTypes = [
  "application/pdf", // PDF
  "image/jpeg", // JPEG
  "image/jpg", // JPG
  "image/png", // PNG
  "application/msword", // DOC
  "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", // DOCX
];

// Max file size: 10MB
const maxSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024;
```

## Backend Requirements

The backend should have these endpoints:

- `POST /api/reports/upload` - Accepts multipart/form-data with "report" field
- `GET /api/reports` - Returns array of user's reports
- `DELETE /api/reports/:id` - Deletes a specific report

Expected response format:

```json
{
  "id": "report_id",
  "fileName": "Blood_Test_Results.pdf",
  "uploadDate": "2025-10-31T12:00:00.000Z",
  "summary": "Optional summary text",
  "fileUrl": "url_to_file"
}
```
