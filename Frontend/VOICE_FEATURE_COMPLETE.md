## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Examples

### Date Patterns

```
"tomorrow" → 2025-11-01
"next Monday" → 2025-11-04
"March 15th" → 2025-03-15
```

### Time Patterns

```
"2 PM" → 14:00
"10:30 AM" → 10:30
"3 o'clock PM" → 15:00
```

### Department Patterns

```
"cardiology" → Cardiology
"heart doctor" → Cardiology (if mentioned)
"orthopedics" → Orthopedics
```

### Personal Info Patterns

```
"my name is John" → name: "John"
"555-123-4567" → phone: "555-123-4567"
"john@email.com" → email: "john@email.com"
```

## 🚀 How It Works

```
User clicks mic → Speech Recognition starts
      ↓
User speaks → Browser transcribes to text
      ↓
Text processed → NLP extracts information
      ↓
Form fields → Auto-filled with extracted data
      ↓
User reviews → Can edit or submit
```

## 🎤 Sample Voice Commands

### Quick Booking

```
"Book me for tomorrow at 2 PM in Cardiology"
```

### Detailed Booking

```
"I need an appointment with Dr. Smith for Orthopedics
next Monday at 10 AM. My name is Sarah Johnson,
phone 555-0123, email sarah@email.com"
```

### Specialist Request

```
"I want to see a dermatologist on March 20th at 3 PM.
This is Mike Brown. I have a skin rash that needs checking."
```
