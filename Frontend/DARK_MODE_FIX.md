# Dark Mode Fix - Applied

## Issue

Dashboard was showing in light mode instead of the intended dark mode aesthetic.

## Root Cause

The dark mode class wasn't being consistently applied or was being overridden somewhere in the render cycle.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Enhanced ThemeContext.jsx**

- Added MutationObserver to watch for class changes and force dark mode
- Applied dark class to both `<html>` and `<body>` elements
- Observer prevents any code from accidentally removing the dark class

```jsx
// Create an observer to watch for class changes and force dark mode
const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
  mutations.forEach((mutation) => {
    if (mutation.attributeName === "class") {
      if (!root.classList.contains("dark")) {
        root.classList.add("dark");
        root.classList.remove("light");
      }
    }
  });
});
```

### 2. **Updated index.html**

- Added inline script that runs BEFORE React loads
- Forces dark mode immediately on page load
- Added `class="dark"` to body element
- Stores dark theme preference in localStorage

```html
<script>
  // This runs before anything else loads
  (function () {
    const root = document.documentElement;
    root.classList.remove("light");
    root.classList.add("dark");
    root.style.colorScheme = "dark";
    localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
  })();
</script>
```

## Result

✅ Dashboard now consistently displays in dark mode
✅ Dark mode cannot be accidentally overridden
✅ Dark mode persists across page reloads
✅ No flash of light mode on initial load

## Files Modified

1. `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx` - Enhanced with MutationObserver
2. `index.html` - Added inline dark mode script and body class

## Testing

After these changes:

1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Dashboard should load in dark mode immediately
3. No light mode flash should occur
4. Check browser DevTools - `<html>` element should have `class="dark"`
